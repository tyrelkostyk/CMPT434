Known Issues:
- Testing timeouts is clunky due to the serialized nature of the Sender program,
  i.e. the timeouts are evaluated once the function is ran, which gets blocked
  by the user input step (the puts() call)
    - I believe that this also messes up the accuracy of the timeouts, however
	  I determined that the way around this issue (threads, e.g. pthreads and
	  mutexes etc.) would have been too much additional work for the benefit.
