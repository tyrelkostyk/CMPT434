Instructions to Run:
1. Start up the tcp_server program. It will default to run on the local machine
address (127.0.0.1), on port 30123
2. Start up a single tcp_client program, on the aforementioned address and port
3. Add and remove key-value pairs as necessary (as described in the a1 spec)
4. Get values one at a time or all at once (again, as described in the a1 spec)
5. Quit both the client and server at the same time by sending 'quit'

Other notes and comments:
- Clients can manually disconnect (e.g. with ctrl+c) and reconnect, and the
server will still be able to communicate and continue operation as normal
without having lost any key-value pairs (so long as the server never stopped)
- This TCP Client-Server implementation can only support a single connection
at a time. Multiple connections could've been added with a fairly similar
implementation / complexity. All that would need to be changed is the
incorporation of pthreads. Of course this would also require the use of resource
protection and concurrency management (e.g. mutexes).
- I did not complete the Proxy or UDP implementations as defined in the
assignment specification. It's been a rough start to the semester...
